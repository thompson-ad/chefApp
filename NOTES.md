# Chef App Notes

A very simple storage solution for chefs and their restaurants

- App is our front end app
- services is our server

after you create the db migration files, you can run `yarn db:migrate` in services and you will see the tables appear in sequel pro.

Once you have DB set up you can then begin to create your server in express and GQL
